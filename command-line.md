Command-Line: Also known as terminal in Linux. A place where we write instructions to the computer, directly, without using a mouse. Only keyboard.

ls: provides a list of contents in the directory one happens to be in when the command is entered. 'ls -al' shows hidden files as well.  
mkdir <name>: makes a new folder  
rm <name>: deletes the specified file 'rm -r' to delete a directory  
cd <name>: changes location into the directory specified after the 'cd' instruction. cd ..: Moves one's location to the parent directory (up-one-level)  
touch <name>: creates a file with the specified name  
mv <original item path> <new item path>: Used to move file from one directory to another, but can also be used to rename a file if same location is specified for both original and final paths  
pwd: displays current location of user
man <command>: When used before a command, it displays the description of the command and any options allowed in conjunction with the command.  
clear: clears the current terminal screen  
cp <original item path> <new item path>: Used to copy file from one location to another, but can also be used to copy a directory by using the 'cp -r' prefix instead of 'cp'.
