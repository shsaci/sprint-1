Command-Line: Also known as terminal in Linux. A place where we write instructions to the computer, directly, without using a mouse. Only keyboard.

ls: provides a list of contents in the directory one happens to be in when the command is entered.  
mkdir <name>: makes a new folder  
rm <name>: deletes the specified file  
cd <name>: changes location into the directory specified after the 'cd' instruction  
cd ..: Moves one's location to the parent directory (up-one-level)  
touch <name>: creates a file with the specified name
